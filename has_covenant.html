    <h1 id='title'>Breck homes that have RRCs on them</h1>
    <div id='map'></div>
    <p>The 50 homes on this map are homes where the directory address matches an address in the Mapping Prejudice database.
    </p>
    <p>Although not represented on the map, faces/names were manually processed to get a better idea of the racial
        demographics of this group. This process is very subjective (and inherently biased), but I feel that it resulted in a more accurate and nuanced view
        that took mixed race people into account. In the end, we found that the group was about 80% white (see plot below).</p>
    <p>Each pin on the map represents an address. Click on the pin view the covenant text/year as well as a list of the students who are associated with
        the address, their grades, and their estimated race/gender. If an address has multiple covenants associated with it, only one of them is shown.</p>
    <p>Disclaimer: Race/gender data was estimated by the FairFace machine learning model using Veracross photos. As a
        result, there are errors and gaps in this aspect of the data. Self-reported information would be much more
        accurate.</p>
