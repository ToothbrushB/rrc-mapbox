    <h1 id='title'>Breck homes that have RRCs on them</h1>
    <div id='map'></div>
    <p>The homes on this map are homes where the directory address matches an address in the Mapping Prejudice database.</p>
    <p>Although not represented on the map, faces/names were manually processed to get a better idea of the racial demographics of this group. This process is very subjective, but we feel that it resulted in a more nuanced view that took mixed race people into account. In the end, we found that the group was about 80% white.</p>
    <p>Each pin on the map represents an address. Click on the pin to get a list of the students who are associated with the address, their grades, and their estimated race/gender.</p>
    <p>Disclaimer: Race/gender data was estimated by the FairFace machine learning model using Veracross photos. As a result, there are errors and gaps in this aspect of the data. Self-reported information would be much more accurate.</p>
