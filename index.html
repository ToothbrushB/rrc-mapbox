    <h1>Restrictive Racial Covenants at Breck</h1>
    <p>Names, faces, grades, and addresses were from the digital student directory and processed with racial covenant
        data.</p>
    <p>Directory data was taken 10/16/2023. It was subject to the following processing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Filtered out addresses outside MN
        </li>
        <li>Removed duplicates (e.g. 2 units at the same apartment complex)
        </li>
        <li>Removed PO Boxes
        </li>
        <li>Parsed the address for street address, city, and zipcode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each student in the directory was mapped to their address(es). The FairFace machine learning model was used to
        process directory photos to estimate each student's race and gender.</p>
    <p>A list of addresses that also appeared in the racial covenant data was generated. The combination of address,
        person, and race data was synthesized into a map.</p>
